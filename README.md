### Abdul Bhutta 
### EE8601: Directed Studies

This is Assignment 1 for Directed Studies which implements the latest version of YOLO algorithm to detect various traffic signs. 
The dataset used in this project is a custom dataset that contains 15 classes of traffic signs and is divided into three parts: train, validation and test. 
The dataset, trained weights and reports links are provided below.
